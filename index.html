<p id ="center"> New York City was ranked third in the country for urban heat island intensity, according to the Climate Central report released in July. Urbanized areas see an increase of more than 7.6 degrees compared to their surrounding suburban areas.

Low income neighborhoods, primarily made up of Black and Brown people, are most affected by heat islands and have higher chances of getting heat-related illnesses and deaths. The South Bronx, Central Brooklyn and South Queens are among the areas with the highest heat indexes, according to New York City’s Department of Health.

  	<h2>Causes</h2>
  	<div> Heat islands are caused by heat-absorbing structures and materials radiating to the environment. Tall buildings, dark and metal surfaces, cement sidewalks, human-created heat emissions and the lack of green spaces contribute to the increase in temperatures. </div>

Low income and non-white neighborhoods are more likely to have apartment complexes and less green spaces than higher income neighborhoods. “Communities of color have 33.5 percent less park space per person within a 10-minute walk compared to white communities,” according to The Trust for Public Land.</div>

  	<h2>Effects</h2>
  	<div> Heat islands increase the chance of heat-related illnesses and deaths. “Every year, NYC experiences an average of 450 heat-related emergency department visits, 150 heat-related hospital admissions, and 13 heat-stroke deaths. The City also averages about 115 excess deaths from natural causes exacerbated by extreme heat annually,” according to the Cool Neighborhoods NYC report. </div>
    <br>
<div> The use increase of air conditioning and energy are also effects. Heat islands make up five to 10 percent of electricity demand in the summer, according to the United States Environmental Protection Agency. The higher use of energy also lowers the air quality. </div>

<div> Aquatic life is at risk as surrounding temperatures heat bodies of water.</div>

  <h2>Solutions</h2>

<div> Incorporating more green spaces, including community gardens are one of the ways to lower the heat. Trees provide shade and remove pollutants, which improve air quality. A “green roof,” also known as a rooftop garden, have been shown to lower electricity usage and temperatures on commercial and residential buildings. “Cool roofs” are also an alternative to combat heat absorption by using materials that would reflect the sun’s rays on top of infrastructure.</div>
